	     		Hello, I'm Faith and I'm a scholar at Smash (1st year), I was born at February 3, 2003. My parents are from Nigeria, which makes me Nigerian. I live in San Lorenzo,CA and go to San Lorenzo High school. I'm the youngest of 2 siblings, I have an older brother. My favorite subjects in schoool are Math, English, and History. My goals right now is to learn as much as possible at Smash, with what I learned at SMASH, I want to be able to make some new friends too, so I could be able stick with them even after SMASH. I like to be as expressive to everyone as possible. I also like to be fit, and I like doing sports like Track & Field!

	 			Before deciding to do sports, I was into playing instruments, but then gave up in playing. I used to play the violin, and the flute. I started playing both the Voilin and flute in 4th-5th grade! I lost intrest in playing them because I wanted to focus more on my academics, and not on instruments, I also thought I was going to need to play an instrument in the future. Boy, I was wrong because playing an instrument is helpful in any class or grade at school.

	 			I just finished my first year of High school, I was great lots of success, fun, adventure, emotions all around the year. I really excited to be able to get into SMASH this summer and for the next 2 summers because with all the  knowledge and wisdom learned from SMASH, I could use it in my regular school to understand more effectively and faster.
